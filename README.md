# PostgreSQL ORM Usage In Java Spring Boot

This is a simple demo project to show how to use ORM with PostgreSQL in Java Spring Boot.

## What Is ORM?
ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. It is a programming technique that allows developers to query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. This eliminates the need for writing complex SQL queries and allows developers to focus on writing code in their preferred programming language. <strong>ORM also avokes the security risks associated with SQL injection attacks.</strong>
